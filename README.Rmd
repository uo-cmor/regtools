The goal of regtools is to provide simple tools for the analysis of regression models.

## Installation

You can install the released version of regtools from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("uo-cmor/regtools")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(regtools)

df <- data.frame(a = 1:12, b = rep(c("b1", "b2", "b3"), c(4, 5, 3)), c = rep(0:1, c(5, 7)))
model <- lm(a ~ b + c, df)

lincom(model, c(1, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2))

lincom(model, rbind(c(1, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2),
                        c(0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.2)))
```
